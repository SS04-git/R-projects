## Introduction

*I am writing this for Arvind's class. Its kind of interesting.*

## My First Piece of R Code

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)

```

## Using the babynames library to get a list of data

```{r}
babynames
```

## Filtering the data

```{r}
babynames %>% filter (name == "Sara")
```

## Creating a graph

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Sara") %>% 
  gf_line(n~year)
```

*Sara was a more popular name than I thought it was.*

## Filtering data and plotting names with different spellings

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Sara"| name == "Sarah") %>% gf_line(n~year)
```

## Filtering the data (part 2)

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Maya"| name == "Maaya")
```

```         
```

## Graph of the received data

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Maya"| name == "Maaya") %>% gf_line (n~year)
```
